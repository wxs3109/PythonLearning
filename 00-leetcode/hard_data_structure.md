### üìå Notes:

- **‚≠ê‚≠ê Level**: Most frequently used in Medium and lower-Hard problems. Must-know for interview prep.
- **‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Level**: Requires template or deep understanding; common in advanced problems.
- **‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Level**: Rare in LeetCode; often found in Codeforces, AtCoder, or competitive contests.
